## Description
This repository contains old preunified version 0.19.8 of [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.19.8) with up-to-date [NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/ShareASmile/NewPipeExtractor/tree/ify) dependency.

The application itself heavily relies on the extractor component which is responsible for proper parsing of various video/audio streams, including Youtube site. The old NewPipe version 0.19.8 depends on old extractor version which is practically deprecated and can't handle current Youtube (and similar?) streams,thus rendering the application useless for daily use.
FoxPipe in this repository uses the updated version of NewPipeExtractor for legacy devices and resolves the forementioned issue, thus making it possible to use old NewPipe version 0.19.8 based FoxPipe with some bug fixes & features added along with updated extractor version. You don't need a YouTube account to use NewPipe, it is a copylefted libre software.

## Motivation

Not so long ago, NewPipe project implemented a new UI elements for video streams. Personally, I didn't like that change. I wanted to keep using the old UI having separate Players(Video, Popup & Background) handling three seperate Queues simultaneously instead.

## Installation and updates
You can install NewPipe using one of the following methods:
 1. Download the APK from [Github Releases](https://github.com/ShareASmile/FoxPipe/releases) and install it.
 2. Build a debug APK yourself or install from [actions](https://github.com/ShareASmile/FoxPipe/actions) This is the fastest way to get new features on your device.

We recommend method 1 for most users. 2. Building a debug APK using method 2 excludes a key entirely. Signing keys help ensure that a user isn't tricked into installing a malicious update to an app.
